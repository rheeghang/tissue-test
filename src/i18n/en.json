        "body": "Entering the lobby, you will find a pedestal. You might have expected to find a sculpture, but the pedestal has nothing visible on it. Song Yeseul's Invisible Sculptures: Air Sculpture is an invisible sensory sculpture and an artistic experiment. Those who wish to \"see\" the floating sculpture are invited to place a hand above the pedestal and feel the vibrating air particles between their fingers. The shape—or sensation—of the sculpture can slightly vary depending on the person's tactile sensitivity. The sculpture is invisible, but we can clearly sense its presence at our fingertips. Using ultrasonic waves and custom software, the artist has designed a certain form and texture of air for visitors to experience for themselves. This work asks us, \"Is 'seeing' really the only way to appreciate art?\" \"What does this sculpture at your fingertips make you think about?\""

        "body": "This installation titled Elephant Without Trunk no.2 is by Oum Jeongsoon, and it's more than just an animal sculpture. The large-scale installation measures 230 centimeters in height, 150 centimeters in width, and 280 centimeters in length. The round and plump body is as big as that of a live elephant, and the stumpy legs are planted firmly on the ground. But, of course, something central to the body is missing—the trunk. So, why is it missing its trunk? The artist presents this elephant as a symbol of a \"stranger,\" an \"other,\" or the \"invisible.\" When we see this trunkless elephant, we notice that it's different from our familiar image of an elephant. This naturally makes us ask ourselves, \"Is an elephant without a trunk not an elephant?\" \"Just because something is invisible, does it mean that it doesn't exist?\" \"Is there really just one familiar image of an elephant in your mind?\""

This series is titled Hidden Whisper, and it depicts the back view of a walking elephant and a bird flapping its wings in soft lines and colors using charcoal, pastel, and crayon. The drawings seem to be in faint motion, almost as if blown in the wind. Where is the elephant headed? If you could touch the blurred lines and smudged colors, what would they feel like? What exactly is it that you're \"looking at\" as opposed to \"feeling?\""

The speakers, measuring 45 centimeters in diameter, read like the Korean consonant ㅇ (ieung)with shapes around them that resemble the Korean vowels ㅏ (a), ㅗ(o), ㅓ (eo), and ㅜ (u). The vowels slowly rotate on a motor, while the sounds of their pronunciations are played on each speaker. The different pitches and rhythms fill the space as they both offset and deflect from one another. Take a moment and listen to the sounds. What are you currently looking at? Can you be sure that what you see relies purely on your eyes? Or are you perhaps seeing with your ears?"

A long, sturdy countertop runs along the wall, and three stools are placed evenly apart in front of it, with space for one more seat reserved for wheelchair users. The countertop, stools, and wall all take on a soft, warm apricot color reminiscent of sun-kissed skin, which happens to be the same color as the artist's skin. Here at the bar, a performer in a black shirt hands you a glass of warm water. The water is heated to match the precise temperature of the artist's real-time body temperature. The performer checks the real-time data using a tablet and meticulously controls the temperature of the water with an electric kettle and a cooking thermometer. The artist is not present on site, but she is transmitting her body temperature in real-time. Now, you're about to have the experience of drinking fluid that's the temperature of someone else's body. How does the lukewarm water feel on your lips? Does it feel warm or strange?"

Audio commentary is provided for those with low vision or those who wish to experience the video through the commentary, and headphones are prepared on the wall to the right of the bench. Throughout this 10-minute-and-33-second video, the camera focuses on the two figures' bodies. The woman in the video is non-hearing and the man can hear. The woman uses sign language to communicate her memories and feelings. Her impression of the man's words and actions during a past trip and hurtful memories of rejection are articulated at the tip of her hands, which halt from time to time in hesitance. The man reaches out and holds her hands. Is this a comforting gesture, or a plea for silence? Here, the artist pays attention to hands as a linguistic and emotional tool. They speak, feel, and express, but they also silence."

Each platform is six meters long and 1.2 meters wide—one is a linear structure with gradual uphill and downhill slopes, while the other takes the structure of a wave with a series of steeper slopes. This work by Song Yeseul, titled Balancing Act, is designed to awaken your sensory perception and rediscover your body language. Designed for two participants to experience at the same time, each participant steps onto one of the two platforms and holds either end of a long illuminating pole with their hands. Now, they walk side by side in the same direction. When the pole is horizontally level, the pole softly illuminates and emits harmonious sounds. In order to keep the light on and continue the chorus, the two participants must work together. If you were to participate, how would you stay in balance with your partner?"

As you look up at the ceiling, sitting or lying on the floor, a large moving image unfolds. The movements created by the rolling, leaning, and connected bodies in the image almost resemble constellations. This work was originally a workshop of the same name held at the ACC in February. Various sounds and voices are played from five five-meter-tall speakers placed around the stage. How are you inclined to move in this space? Do you want to sit, lie down, or roll around? How does your body react when a stranger's body approaches? When do the sounds become independent or entangled? Do the voices comfort you, or are they mere resonances? Whose bodily gesture are you focusing on at the moment?"

        "body": "The 2025 ACC CONTACT exhibition Crossing the Line: Our Bodies, Embedded with Others both mediates acknowledgment of diversity while simultaneously inquiring into the attitude with which to perceive differences. We all draw various mental borderlines as attested by the notions of \"inside and outside,\" \"us and them,\" \"safety and danger,\" and \"myself and others.\" But what if borderlines are a strictly contingent concept; what if we, too, can be an \"other\" to someone else? With me being who I am and you being who you are, what forms of asymmetrical communication can we contrive to coexist?"
